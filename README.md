Hey, I'm glad you stop by! <br />

My name is Anna, I'm 29 years old, from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, now based in Barcelona - Spain.<br />
I work at <a href="https://qatium.com/" target="_blank">Qatium</a> as a Product Engineer, working on developing, maintaining, and supporting our Digital Water Management Platform.<br />
Also, I lived in Copenhagen - Denmark, and there I worked for <a href="https://walor.io/" target="_blank">Walor</a> as a Full-Stack Developer and contributed to <a href="https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/" target="_blank">Hack Your Future Denmark</a> as a Mentor, helping the students with programming challenges that they face in the curriculum.<br />
I graduate as a Computer Scientist and System Development Analyst by <a href="https://descomplica.com.br/faculdade/tecnologia/ciencia-da-computacao/" target="_blank">Descomplica</a> a college that allowed me to become a bachelor from anywhere in the world.<br />


üíûÔ∏è I'm a front-end developer because it perfectly combines 3 areas that are important to me:<br />
1 - It's visual but still requires logical thinking<br />
2 - It's all about solving problems for real people<br />
3 - It's creative and allows me to focus on building stuff<br />
