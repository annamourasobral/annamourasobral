### Hey, I'm glad you stop by!
 
### My name is Anna, I'm 26 years old, from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, now based in Copenhagen - Denmark.
### I work at [Walor](walor.io) as a Frontend Developer, working alongside with the CTO and interns developing, maintaining and supporting our Whistleblowing Platform.
### Also, I contribute with [Hack Your Future Denmark](https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/) as a Mentor, reviewing Pull Requests, supporting teachers in class and helping the students with programming challenges that they face in the curriculum.
### I'll soon graduate as Computer Scientist by [Descomplica](https://descomplica.com.br/faculdade/a/) a college that allowed me become bachelor from anywhere in the world.


### üíûÔ∏è I'm a front-end developer because it perfectly combines 3 areas that are important to me:
### 1- It's visual but still requires logical thinking
### 2 - It's all about solving problems for real people
### 3 - It's creative and allows me to focus on building stuff

### Technologies that I've been working with
